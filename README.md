# Privileged Account Monitoring Lab

## Objective
This project demonstrates how privileged account activity can be monitored,
analyzed, and secured in enterprise environments.

It focuses on identifying risky administrator behavior and aligning controls
with Privileged Access Management (PAM) practices used in CyberArk.

## Key Focus Areas

- Monitoring admin logins
- Tracking privilege usage
- Detecting suspicious activity
- Protecting critical accounts

## Why This Matters

Privileged accounts are the #1 target in cyber attacks.
Monitoring them is a core responsibility of CyberArk administrators.
